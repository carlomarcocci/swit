## Istallation
1. clone the project in a local folder DEPLOYHOME
2. run ./sysconf/init_project.sh inside the project directory. It crates, runs and inizializes the containers
3. the project uses the .env file to set enviroment variables as pass and path.
    At the first installation, if the .env file does'nt exist, init_project creates it based on env_template.
    If you want define path and/or password you have to create .env file before starting inid_project
